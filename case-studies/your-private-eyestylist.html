                      <p>More and more people are buying glasses online these days, but they’re not sure what type of frames work well for them.  Your Private EyeStylist can help advise you on the look you are trying to achieve through online consultations.</p>

                      <p   class="study-pad">Sometimes it’s hard deciding on what frames to get.  The process can be overwhelming and confusing.  What look do I want?  Does the look of the frame fit my personality and personal goals?  Do the frames fit my bone structure and skin tone?</p>
                      <p   class="study-pad">The Private EyeStylist business idea was created by Eric Jay - a 25 year licensed Optician and Eyewear Stylist.  My job was to help him fulfill his vision of taking what he loves to do at his eyewear shop to an online platform.</p>
                      <p   class="study-pad">I had to help Eric come with a way to present his credentials, why the user would need this service, and options for buying in.  This needed to be done in a fashionable way to show that Eric has a good fashion sense.</p>

                      <h2  class="study-pad section-header">The Solution</h2>
                      <p   class="study-pad">For those people looking to change or enhance their look, they can view his process and pick a consultation package that best fits their needs.  Consultations can be as simple as filling out a questionnaire and uploading a selfie or an in person video chat.  For select cases Eric will even come to your home.</p>

                          <p class="study-pad">While there are not many direct competitors in this space, there are a number of sites out there where you can purchase frames online.  I analyzed each of those sites for features that we might consider adding to Your Private Eyestylist.  One feature we are considering for a future release is the ability to upload a picture of yourself and then select frames to transpose over your face.  We opted to move this into a later round simply because the site itself doesn’t sell products at this point, but rather Eric’s services.</p>
