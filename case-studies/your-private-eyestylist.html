                      <p>More and more people are buying glasses online these days, but they’re not sure what type of frames work well for them.  Your Private EyeStylist can help advise you on the look you are trying to achieve through online consultations.</p>

                      <p   class="study-pad">Sometimes it’s hard deciding on what frames to get.  The process can be overwhelming and confusing.  What look do I want?  Does the look of the frame fit my personality and personal goals?  Do the frames fit my bone structure and skin tone?</p>
                      <p   class="study-pad">The Private EyeStylist business idea was created by Eric Jay - a 25 year licensed Optician and Eyewear Stylist.  My job was to help him fulfill his vision of taking what he loves to do at his eyewear shop to an online platform.</p>
                      <p   class="study-pad">I had to help Eric come with a way to present his credentials, why the user would need this service, and options for buying in.  This needed to be done in a fashionable way to show that Eric has a good fashion sense.</p>

                      <h2  class="study-pad section-header">The Solution</h2>
                      <p   class="study-pad">For those people looking to change or enhance their look, they can view his process and pick a consultation package that best fits their needs.  Consultations can be as simple as filling out a questionnaire and uploading a selfie or an in person video chat.  For select cases Eric will even come to your home.</p>

                          <p class="study-pad">While there are not many direct competitors in this space, there are a number of sites out there where you can purchase frames online.  I analyzed each of those sites for features that we might consider adding to Your Private Eyestylist.  One feature we are considering for a future release is the ability to upload a picture of yourself and then select frames to transpose over your face.  We opted to move this into a later round simply because the site itself doesn’t sell products at this point, but rather Eric’s services.</p>

The first was a serif font called Lora for headings that was paired with a sans-serif Roboto font.  I also presented a more modern look with Nunito Sans for the headings paired with Roboto. The last option featured a Poppins-Roboto pairing.  The client decided on the second option, using Nunito Sans & Roboto.</p>

                      <p   class="study-pad">With this project, I learned I need to be flexible with my clients.  If they ask for a particular color it’s best not to just say no if you don’t think it will work, but to show them their idea and explain why the color isn’t the best choice.  I also learned that I can push my design skills further by trying different layouts. By researching current designs I was inspired to design two layouts that I never dreamed I would be able to do.
In addition, I learned that some initial ideas might develop into better ideas.  For example, the Hall of Frames section is good for showing and selling products, however, since the client is not initially going to sell products a  “Styles I like and why” section is more applicable so potential users of the service can read about Eric’s style preferences and see the styles he likes.</p>
                      <p   class="study-pad">I’m currently working with the client on content for the secondary pages which I build out as time permits.</p>
                      <p   class="study-pad">The site was designed using Sketch and is currently being built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The site is hosted on GitHub. </p>
